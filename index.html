          <h2>Meet Kathryn</h2>
          <p>
            The Kathryn Standard grew out of the conversations women kept having in hallways, DMs
            and side chats — about what actually works, what’s marketing, and how to hold a higher
            standard for our faces, our health and our work.

        <div class="about-body">
          <p>
            Kathryn works at the intersection of aesthetics, peptides, supplements and business.
            She has spent years inside beauty and wellness spaces — consulting, testing, listening —
            and this site is where she distills those experiences into something quieter and more useful.
